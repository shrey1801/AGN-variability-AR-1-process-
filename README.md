# AGN-variability-AR-1-process- 
To simulate the light curve coming from the accretion disc of a supermassive black-hole, we assumed that the 
variability arises due to fluctuations in the viscocity parameter. We assumed that the viscocity/ Temperature fluctuates as an autoregressive AR(1) 
process.  The power-spectrum density of the resulting light curve shows a slope similar to what one expets from real data
